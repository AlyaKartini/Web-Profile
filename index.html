                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™m Alya, and I wear many hats in life, including a dental assistance, a mentee at Infinite Learning, and an Accounting student. Iâ€™m a student at Universitas Terbuka majoring in Accounting. As we might know, at UT, most students are working professionals. Well, that includes me too. I work as a dental assistant at a private dental clinic. If you look at my background, all my experiences seem a bit mismatched, don't they? Haha. I'm a dental assistant, yet I'm studying Accounting, and this semester, I'm learning to create websites. It's a bit of a mixed bag, like a fruit salad. But in the end, I've come to realize that I can learn things quickly. Besides that, I'm aware that sometimes I only scratch the surface and don't delve deep enough, so I can't call myself an expert just yet.</p>

                    <h2>Infinite Learning's Story</h2>
                    <p>I have a short story about why I became interested in pursuing Studi Independen at Infinite Learning. Honestly, I was getting quite fed up with all the routines. So, I decided to apply for MSIB, and I got accepted into this program. It turns out, after a few months of being a mentee at Infinite Learning, I found immense joy in learning about the world of web development and all its intricacies. I felt really happy while learning about design, brainstorming with my group mates, presenting our group's work, learning to use various tools for collaborative projectsâ€”basically, everything about this program. Although, there were a few group dramas and frustrating moments too, haha. But, I'm really happy that I chose Infinite Learning as my starting point for studying website development. The mentors are all fantastic and have been incredibly helpful throughout my journey in learning to create website like this.</p>

                    <p>Financial Statement</p>
                    <p>I used to create financial reports for all sorts of companies, whether they were service-based or involved in trading. It became second nature to me! I have 9 months of experience in preparing financial statements for MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises). The MSME's offer hijabs and clothes as their products.</p>

                    <span>2</span>
                    <p>Dental assistant</p>
                    <p>Actually, this skill is the one I've been dedicated to the longest. I have 4 years of experience in dental assisting. This skill represents my current job; I've been working as a dental assistant since I graduated from high school.</p>
